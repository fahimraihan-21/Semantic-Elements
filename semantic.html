        <h2>
            Pablo Escobar

        </h2>
        <p>
        Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria 1 December 1949 – 2 December 1993) was a Colombian drug lord, narcoterrorist, and politician who was the founder and
        sole leader of the Medellín Cartel. Dubbed "the king of cocaine", Escobar was one of the wealthiest criminals in
        history, having amassed an estimated net worth of US$30 billion by the time of his death—equivalent to $70 billion as of
        2022
        —while his drug cartel monopolized the cocaine trade into the United States in the 1980s and early 1990s
        </p>
        <p>In 1976, Escobar founded the Medellín Cartel, which distributed powder cocaine, and established the first smuggling
        routes from Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador, through Colombia and eventually into the United States. Escobar's infiltration
        into the U.S. created exponential demand for cocaine and by the 1980s it was estimated Escobar led monthly shipments of
        70 to 80 tons of cocaine into the country from Colombia. As a result, he quickly became one of the richest people in the
        world,[1][3] but constantly battled rival cartels domestically and abroad, leading to massacres and the murders of
        police officers, judges, locals, and prominent politicians.</p>

        <h3>
           Death
        </h3>
        <p>
            Escobar faced threats from the Colombian police, the U.S. government and his rivals, the Cali Cartel. On 2 December
            1993, Escobar was found in a house in a middle-class residential area of Medellín by Colombian special forces, using
            technology provided by the United States which allowed them to trace Escobar's location after he made a call to his
            family. Police tried to arrest Escobar but the situation quickly escalated to an exchange of gunfire. Escobar was shot
            and killed while trying to escape from the roof, along with a bodyguard who was also shot. He was hit by bullets in the
            torso and feet, and a bullet which struck him in the head, killing him. This sparked debate about whether he killed
            himself or whether he was shot and killed.
